# Project Statement:

The fashion and lifestyle industry faces several challenges in meeting the ever-evolving needs and preferences of consumers in a rapidly changing world. Addressing these challenges will require collaborative efforts from various stakeholders, including fashion designers, manufacturers, retailers, policymakers, and consumers themselves. By tackling these issues, the fashion and lifestyle industry can move towards a more sustainable, inclusive, and technologically advanced future.

 
# Project Description:

A fashion designer conceives garment combinations of line, proportion, color, and texture. While sewing and pattern-making skills are beneficial, they are not a pre-requisite of successful fashion design. Most fashion designers are formally trained or apprenticed.
A technical designer works with the design team and the factories overseas to ensure correct garment construction, appropriate fabric choices and a good fit. The technical designer fits the garment samples on a fit model, and decides which fit and construction changes to make before mass-producing the garment
